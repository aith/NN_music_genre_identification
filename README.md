## Music Genre Classification with Keras & GTZAN

A project to learn more about Neural Networks and how Music Classification can be performed using them.  
Testing Accuracy hovers around 70%. With my ecclectic sample of 10 tracks, the accuracy hovers 60%.

## How to run
To run the notebook as-is, you'll need to download the GTZAN dataset and put it in a /DATA folder.
